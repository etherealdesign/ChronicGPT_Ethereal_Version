## About ✨
A frontend application built with Vite and React. It provides a scroll-driven landing experience featuring:
- Smooth scrolling provided by `lenis`.
- Timeline-driven interactions built on `gsap` with `ScrollTrigger`.
- UI primitives and accessibility utilities from `@radix-ui`.
- Tailwind CSS for styling (via `@tailwindcss/vite`).

This repository contains the client-side code (UI and static assets) and assumes a separate backend/service for any AI or API calls.

Notes:
- `src/components/RouterContainer.jsx` contains route definitions and scroll-to-top logic on route change.
- `src/App.jsx` contains the main visual sections, GSAP timelines and the scroll pinning setup.
- `src/components/common/` holds many reusable UI building blocks used across pages.

---

## Routing 🧭
Implemented with React Router. Notable routes:
- `/` → main landing (App)
- `/safeguards` → Safeguards page
- `/journey` → Journey page
- `/how-it-works` → WIP

Router resets Lenis scroll position on route change for smooth UX.

## Local development 🛠️
1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:etherealdesign/chronic-gpt-fe.git
cd chronicGPTFE
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port printed by Vite). The dev server supports HMR.

---

## Build & deployment 🚀
Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Deployment: any static host works (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, GitHub Pages). Upload the `dist/` folder produced by `npm run build`.

---

## Linting & formatting 🧹
ESLint is included. Run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

(You can add Prettier or other formatting tools if desired.)

## Contributing 🤝
If you plan to contribute, please:
1. Open an issue describing the change or feature.
2. Create a topic branch from `master`.
3. Add clear commit messages and a short PR description.

Developer notes:
- Reuse components in `src/components/common/` where possible.
- Keep animation logic in `App.jsx` minimal; prefer encapsulating repeated animation sequences in small components or utility hooks.
